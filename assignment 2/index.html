                             The Tocumwal Archive is a collection of stories and photographs, about living in the houses that were moved from the Tocumwal air force base in New South Wales, to the Canberra suburb of O'Connor. 
                        </p>
                        
                             
                            <p>
                            The base was built during the Second World War as an inland defence against Japanese invasion. As camouflage, the sleeping quarters for air force personnel were built in the form of houses. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            
                             After the War, the acute housing shortage in Canberra gave the houses a new purpose. From the late 1940s, about 200 of them were transported to the growing suburbs of Ainslie and O'Connor. </p>
                        <p>
                             In O'Connor they were located in two groups of four cul-de-sacs meeting at a central park and bounded by Macarthur, Macpherson, Miller and Tate Streets. The area is listed as an Australian Capital Territory (ACT) heritage precinct. </p>
                        <p>
                             Collection for the Archive began in 1996 with a PhotoAccess project supported by the ACT Heritage Council. Stories and photographs are archived according to the donor's name. Ongoing community collection and maintenance of the Archive is encouraged. </p>
                        <p>
                             The Archive is open for research use and the contribution of material at the ACT Heritage Library in the Woden Town Library. </p>

                        <h2>Heritage Listing</h2>
                     <h3>Statement of Significance</h3>
                     <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UC-Design/11056-front-end/master/assessment/source-content/tocumwal/images/trove/tocumwal-trove-1.jpg" alt="black and white">
                            <p>
                            The Tocumwal Housing Precinct in O'Connor is significant as an outstanding example of low cost pre-fabricated housing, which was constructed in Canberra after World War 2.</p>
                     <p>

                            As part of the Government's solution to the critical housing shortage being experienced in Canberra at the time, many of the houses originally constructed at Tocumwal in NSW for the US Army Air Corps were re-erected in the ACT. The cottages are of distinctive design types and limited geographically to the O'Connor Precinct and a small area in Ainslie. </p>
                     
                     <p>

                            The Precinct remains the most intact example of this style of housing and is unique in Canberra for its urban planning, landscaping and social history. </p>
                     <p>

                            The eight culs de sac evident in the precinct share access onto a community recreation area with the individual identity of each street reinforced by the street plantings. Many of the cottages retain their original hedge plantings. The 'precinctual' planning is thus significant. </p>
                     <p>

                            The sense of cohesion of the streetscapes within the Precinct is achieved by the repetition of features in the housing stock, and the integration of this with unifying street plantings and hedges. It creates an area of high aesthetic value.

                            <h2>Origins</h2>
                        
                            <h3>1.1The Origins of Canberra's Tocumwal houses </h3>
<p>
                            After the bombing of Darwin, the United States and Australia made joint plans for Australian inland defence. The Tocumwal airfield was the largest and first of several large airfields planned for construction in relation to the the line of possible Japanese advance. </p>
                            <p>
                                It was built by the Australian Government (Australian Civil Construction Corps and Allied Works Council) on behalf of the United States Army Air Force between February and April 1942. </p>
                            <p> 
                                Five thousand people were involved in the construction of the base which was designed to stage bombing raids and reconnaisance flights, as well as take the role of the first training centre in the South-West Pacific for Liberators. </p>
                            <p>
                                Not long after the 'houses' were erected at the end of the building process, the Battle of the Coral Sea halted the Japanese advance and the USAAF decided to move north to Townsville. </p>
                            <p>
                                The Royal Australian air force officially took over the running of Tocumwal in November 1942, establishing it as a hospital and training base.</p>

                            <h3>1.2 The Tocumwal air force base </h3>
                        
                        
                            <p>
                            My family was aware of Tocumwal and its houses long before they became a feature of the streets of O'Connor. My father, Hartley Hollier, was a serving member of the RAAF from 1936-46 and was actually stationed at Tocumwal when the 'Tocumwal houses' were in that town, newly-built and functioning as they had been designed to function. </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            The Tocumwal air force base was part of the 'Brisbane Line' strategy of World War II. The Brisbane Line was, in fact, an imaginary line drawn on a map connecting Perth with Brisbane. This effectively divided Australia into two segments. The thinking was that we could afford to lose everything above the line, if needs be, to an invading Japanese force - but we would fight to the death to keep everything below it. For this reason various air force bases were strategically placed just inside the 'line', and Tocumwal was one of these locations. </p>
                            <p>

                            What we know as the 'Tocumwal houses' were built in Tocumwal for the purpose of setting up the air force base. The whole base was designed to look like any Australian country town, and was virtually all accommodated in the 'houses'. It had roads and streets laid out and I imagine that the aircraft hangars and workshops might have looked like the local school or public hall.</p>
                           
                            <p> 
                            The houses had no partitioning inside and most of them served as sleeping quarters for the men. They had a half-hourly bus service and the bus would pick up personnel and drop them where they needed to go. The vital purpose for designing a base in such a form was that, should enemy surveillance aircraft fly overhead, all that they would see would be an ordinary town. </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            After the end of World War II the air force base at Tocumwal was no longer needed. I imagine there was at first a feeling of, 'What on earth are we going to do with all this lot?' But, concurrently, Canberra was developing fast by the mid-1940s and someone had the brilliant idea (or so it would seem, with hindsight) of bringing the houses and re-erecting them here.

                        Like many others Stanley Mawston (Bluey) Forster went to join up in 1942. Because of his building qualifications and ability to read plans - blueprints as they were referred to in those days - he was seconded to the Dept of the Interior. His was to be a different kind of war. </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Stan arrived in Tocumwal by train with troops and personnel like himself, late one Saturday afternoon. After a twenty two hour train ride to what felt like the ends of the earth all he and his travelling companions could think of was a long cold beer. After spending most of his life on the coast of NSW he found this flat, dry and seemingly barren country a vast contrast to the lush coast that he had been used to. </p>

                            <p>
                            The men were housed in tents on the 'drome and worked daylight to dark. They were mainly men of the 3Cs - Civil Construction Corps - and Stan was foreman on the cook house and picture theatre as well as the houses. </p>

                            <p>
                            Initially in Tocumwal for 10-12 weeks, the majority of the men were then sent on to Amberly air force base. After his release from the Dept of the Interior Stan returned to Tocumwal and worked as a builder in the town and district until he accepted the position of caretaker in 1957 at the aerodrome. A small contingent of officers and enlisted men were still stationed there until 1964 and on their departure, Stan moved into a residence on site. At this time all remaining fixtures and buildings on the 'drome were sold or removed. </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Stan had bought the house that he and his family moved into in 1964 and spent his spare time renovating it with the view of moving it into town to retire in. After the completion and refit he chose to sell and return to Wollongong and the family home they had left behind twenty seven years before. </p>

                            <h3>2.1 From Tocumwal to Canberra</h3>
                            <p>
                            After the Second World War, the development of Canberra as the national capital was revitalised. The final move of central Commonwealth administration from Melbourne to Canberra involved thousands of people and a huge building program that included the creation of new suburbs as well as offices, schools and all the general city infrastructure. </p>
                            <p>
                            In its quest to meet the growing housing needs of Canberra at a time of extreme shortage of building materials the National Capital Planning and Development Committee was interested in available prefabricated houses. </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            The transportation of a number of the Tocumwal houses and their installation in Ainslie and O'Connor was arranged. In Ainslie they were located in various streets amongst other types of housing, but in O'Connor they were established in a specific location that is now the O'Connor Tocumwal heritage precinct. </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Jim Perry was the builder who won the contract to install the houses in O'Connor. 
                            </p>    
                              
                            
                            <h3>2.2 On the road</h3>
                            <p>
                            I lived near the Murray Valley Highway. I remember seeing houses in sections going along the highway on big trucks. The Murray Valley Highway was really narrow and they seemed to take up all of the road. I knew they came from Tocumwal but I didn't know where they were going. We saw them frequently. It wasn't until many years later that I found out where their journeys ended.</p>

                            1947-50 observed the Tocumwal houses being moved while on a vegetation survey of the Murray Valley (Grass Tree Association) with CWE (Ted) Moore - a CSIRO research program.</p>

                            Alby and Dot Day moved into Hart Street in 1949. At this time the Tocumwal houses were still being put up in the O'Connor area and Alby, who worked for the Transport Section, would help with the unloading as the dismantled houses arrived. Dot remembers that they always arrived in the evening. </p>

                            <p>
                            John Barty was employed as a carpenter on the construction of houses at the Tocumwal air force base. Like Stanley Forster he was in the Civil Construction Corps during the war. </p>
                            <p>
                            He travelled as far afield as the Northern Territory doing this work. After the war, he was attracted by the building work opportunities in Canberra and he and his family moved to Canberra from Finley in 1947. One of the first jobs he was employed on was re-erecting the Tocumwal houses in Ainslie. In 1953 the Barty's were allocated a Tocumwal house in Todd Street, O'Connor. </p>

                            <p>
                            Owen Taverner and his partners Billy Moore and Billy Goggin had the contract with Jim Perry to build the footings and chimneys for '100 Tocumwal cottages in O'Connor'. They were the 'very first things to be built past the pines' (Haig Park). There was no road beyond Haig Park - they'd get through on tracks. 'From Haig Park to the end of Turner was dirt.' </p>

                            One of the things that amazed Owen about the houses was that they were erected without concrete foundations. 'I'll bet you any money you like, there's nowhere else like that in Canberra'. They laid the bricks straight on to the ground - two courses sideways in trenches that were dug for them by the contractor, and the footings on top. 'We often wondered about that, but the houses are all still there.'

                            Jim Perry was the builder. He had the contract to erect the Tocumwal houses. But Owen remembers that 'to all intents and purposes Tommy O'Connor was the main man' - he was from Queanbeyan - O'Connor constructions. </p>

                            Owen and his partners worked on the contract for about six months and he remembers that the forty hour week came in towards the end of the contract - 1948. </p>
